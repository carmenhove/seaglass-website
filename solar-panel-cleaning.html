                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
                <h3> How often should I clean my solar panels? </h3>
            
                <p> Due to our local climate, the degree of tree cover, and proximity to waterfront across most buildings in Kitsap County, we find that solar panels in our area generally need more regular cleanings than those in other climates. If your home is situated close to a lot of trees, a busy road, or waterfront then it's more likely that your solar panels will benefit from regular cleaning. Bird droppings, in particular, pose a unique threat to the integrity of solar panels because of the acidity. If a lot of debris has accumulated on your panels, having them professionally cleaned may result in at least a 6% increase in efficiency <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzoto1UDsVQ" target="_blank">based on user research</a></p>
                
                <p>If your roof pitch is fairly steep and your home is not close to trees, waterfront, or a busy road, then your solar panels may only need infrequent cleaning based on the results of a <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/release/1393?id=1393" target="_blank">study out of UC San Diego</a>. Rest assured that we will never try to sell you on something you don't need. You also have the power to evaluate the effects of any professional solar panel cleaning you pay for using your monthly energy data.</p>
            
                <h3> Can I clean my solar panels by myself? </h3>
                <p>To clean any roof-mounted solar panels, we always recommend hiring a professional. To safely clean a rooftop solar panel you need training, experience,  and specialized equipment (e.g., poles, cleaning equipment, work boots with appropriate tread, a safety harness and rope, ladders, ladder stand-offs, and ladder stabilizers). Due to the equipment needed and the risk involved, it is much faster, safer, and more cost-effective to hire a licensed and insured professional. In the USA alone, <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/03/13/ladder-safety-month/#:~:text=March%20is%20the%20first%2Dever,2%20from%20ladder%2Drelated%20injuries." target="_blank"> over half a million people</a> are admitted to the emergency room every year for ladder related injuries.</p>
