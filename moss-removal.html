            <section>
              <p> If you see green stuff on your roof, you're not alone! Due to our climate, moss grows rapidly on roof surfaces. When left unchecked, moss shoots spores underneath the roof shingles, slowly pushing them upwards and eventually causing leaks.</p>
              
              <p>Before applying a moss treatment, we recommend blowing debris off the roof and <a href="roof-and-gutter-cleaning.html">cleaning your gutters and downspouts</a> to get the most out of your service. </p>

            <section class="our-process">
              <h2> Our process </h2>
              <p>We opt for what we believe to be the safest and most effective <em>long-term</em> solution: <a href="https://dochub.clackamas.us/documents/drupal/ad9e796c-87d8-484e-ad9c-f464e5fef7f9" target="_blank">sodium bicarbonate</a>.</p>

              <img src="images/roof-treated.jpg" alt="" class="wrapped-img">

              <p>Sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda, kills moss and prevents future growth by altering the pH of the roof surface. Baking soda won't remove the moss all at once. After application, existing moss will start to die and the altered pH will prevent further growth. If the moss is extensive, it will take multiple treatments to completely erradicate. </p>
              
              <p>Some companies opt for a more aggressive approach involving brushes, pressure washers, or other tools to mechanically remove the moss - but this won't prevent future growth and can easily damage the shingles and void your roof warranty. Using harsher chemicals (especially those containing zinc) are effective at killing moss but can cause health problems for the person applying the treatment and the run-off is harmful to pets, plants, and wildlife. </p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
              
                <h3>Can I treat roof moss myself?</h3>
                
                <p>When it comes to moss removal and moss treatment, we strongly recommend that you leave it to the professionals. To safely apply a moss treatment to any roof, you need training and experience as well as specialized equipment (e.g., work boots with appropriate tread, a safety harness and rope, ladders, ladder stand-offs, ladder stabilizers). Due to the equipment needed and the risk involved, it is much faster, safer, and more cost-effective to hire a licensed and insured professional. In the USA alone, <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/03/13/ladder-safety-month/#:~:text=March%20is%20the%20first%2Dever,2%20from%20ladder%2Drelated%20injuries." target="_blank"> over half a million people</a> are admitted to the emergency room every year for ladder related injuries.</p>
