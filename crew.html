            <h2> Jordan McGrath </h2>
            <p>After beginning my career in the non-profit world, I pivoted to entrepreneurship within the home service/maintenance industry in 2018. I’m passionate about serving my neighbors and community, and this passion ultimately led to starting SeaGlass Cleaning Services. When I’m not unclogging your gutters or cleaning your windows, I love practicing yoga, going to concerts, flying my kites, or just hanging out at home with my wife Sarah, dog Piglet, and cat Mr. Lump. Go Packers.</p>

            <p>After spending a decade doing research on human health and working in data and analytics, I decided I wanted to use these skills within the trades rather than inside an office. I joined SeaGlass in summer 2024. When I’m not working, I love building things, weightlifting, trail running, and reading good books. Go Mariners. </p>
