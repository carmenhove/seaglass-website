                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
                <h3> What are the benefits of having my roof and gutters professionally cleaned?</h3>
                <p>Aside from providing shelter and insulation, the main purpose of a roof is to shed water and debris. The purpose of the gutter system is to then collect the water and debris coming off the roof and deposit it away from the building to prevent damage to the siding and the foundation. No matter how steep the pitch of the roof, debris (e.g., fir needles, pine cones, wet leaves) will still accumlate over time, which is why routine maintenance is crucial. Debris that sits on a roof for too long will eventually lead to rot and will encourage the growth of moss, algae, and mold. Likewise, gutters that are not regularly cleaned of debris will clog, pushing mud and rainwater back up under the shingles. Debris left in your gutters may even cause the underground drain pipes connected to your downspouts to clog, requiring a plumber and a big chunk of change.</p>
         
                <h3>Can I clean my roof and gutters myself?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to roof and gutter cleaning, leave it to the professionals. To safely clean any roof, you need training and experience as well as specialized equipment (e.g., a gas or electric backpack blower, work boots with appropriate tread, a safety harness and rope, ladders, ladder stand-offs, ladder stabilizers, buckets, and a gutter spoon). Due to the equipment needed and the risk involved, it is much faster, safer, and more cost-effective to hire a licensed and insured professional. In the USA alone, <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/03/13/ladder-safety-month/#:~:text=March%20is%20the%20first%2Dever,2%20from%20ladder%2Drelated%20injuries." target="_blank"> over half a million people</a> are admitted to the emergency room every year for ladder related injuries. It's not worth the risk. </p>
                
                <h3> How much will it cost to get my roof and gutters cleaned?</h3>
                <p>It depends, because every company has a different pricing structure and roof and gutter systems are unique to each building. At SeaGlass, we have a price per square foot for roof and gutter cleaning that varies depending on roof pitch, roof complexity (e.g., number of dormers, hips, and valleys), and gutter complexity. Schedule a quote and we'll evaluate the specifics of your home or business in-person. </p>
                
                <h3> Should I pressure wash my roof and gutters? </h3>
                <p>No, don't pressure wash your roof and gutters! Pressure washers are amazing tools for cleaning solid non-porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and patios, but they can cause extensive damage to roof shingles, gutters, and soffit. Even if using a pressure washer doesn't cause immediately noticeable damage, it will almost always void the warranty on your roof. This is true even for metal roofs and means that you won't be covered in the event of storm damage, which is a significant risk here in the Pacific Northwest. Yikes!</p>
        
                <h3> How often should I have my roof and gutters cleaned? </h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, we recommend getting your roof and gutters cleaned at least twice a year. If your home or business is in a heavily wooded area with lots of tree cover, you'll probably need more regular cleanings to prevent clogs, leaks, and moss growth. A regular bi-annual maintenance schedule will also keep you informed of any larger problems, such as degraded shingles and broken downspouts.</p>

                <h3> There is moss growing on my roof. How do I get rid of it? </h3>
                <p>We always recommend applying a moss treatment after having your roof and gutters cleaned. For more information, check out our <a href="moss-removal.html">moss removal services.</a></p>
